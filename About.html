        <p class = "text">When I am not studying or working, I love to drink mate, hang out with friends, play volleyball or even design websites like this one ;-). 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I am originally from Germany but have been living in Uruguay for a very long time, I love this country and will definitely stay here forever. I live here in a nice apartment together with my twin sister and two cats in the city center.
        <br/>
        <br/>I am an outgoing person that likes to be always busy with something. I am also pretty resilient when it comes to achieving what I set myself as goal. I naturally love to help others and always lend a hand whenever I can. However, I am always acceptive of constructive critizism and try to get better every day.</p>
