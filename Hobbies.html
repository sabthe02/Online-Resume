<h1> Hobbies</h1>

<p>When I'm not working, I'll be probably hanging out on the promenade with mate tea and some friends, playing volleyball or just lie on the beach (in summer). I also have two adorable cats that I enjoy having around :-).
    Some of my other hobbies are learning languages and website design.
